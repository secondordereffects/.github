<h1 align="center">Decisions have consequences you didn't model.</h1>

  <strong>A rigorous, evidence-based catalog of hidden consequences in systems and decisions.</strong><br>
  Evidence-based analyses across 8 categories. Every claim quantified. Every source cited.

## How it works

Every analysis follows the **CHAIN Framework**:

```
C — Context       What's the situation? What decision is being made?
H — Hypothesis    What do people expect? (the first-order claim)
A — Actual Chain  What actually happens? (2nd, 3rd, 4th order effects)
I — Impact        Quantified consequences (before/after/delta)
N — Navigation    Don't-if / If-you-must / Alternatives
```

Every entry includes falsifiability criteria — what would prove it wrong.

**This is not a blog.** It's a reference library for decision-makers who want to avoid predictable surprises.
